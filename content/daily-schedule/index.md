The daily schedule at Gesher ensures that campers of all age groups get to experience the most with their days. The schedule does change from time to time to allow for special events to create that sense of surprise and excitement for the campers. See an example of just one day of what is going on with all our age groups.

On top of these daily specialty programs, campers have work and interest groups they can join. The campers choose the groups they would like to participate in so there is a level of customization to their days. Examples of some of these interest groups are: helping in the kitchen, getting Red Cross Bronze Cross certified or yoga instruction.

Evening programsÂ are generally camp wide activities that can be anything from educational activities, to singing, to capture the flag. Bedtime begins right after the evening activity for our youngest groups and then proceeds every 15-30 minutes after for the succeeding age groups.
