## Safety

At Gesher we understand that the safety of our campers is of the utmost importance. That is why we also use licensed and insured companies to transport our campers to and from camp, as well as on any field trips during the summer. At Camp, we use a local bus company to transport our campers in large groups, and we have insured vehicles and drivers for smaller groups.

## Field Trips

Campers may go on a couple field trips during the summer. Past field trips include going to local farms, visiting nearby cities, experiencing Bon Echo Provincial Park, and more. We always send lifeguards on our trips to ensureÂ we are as prepared as possible in the case of a medical emergency. Campers are never left alone on field trips.
