Camp Gesher is accredited with the Ontario Camping Association (OCA) and we strictly follow their guidelines. We receive top scores every summer with OCA safety inspections. We are proud to provide a diverse set of programs while maintaining an impeccable health and safety record

Each program is designed with multiple checks to ensure health and safety standards are not only met but exceeded. Below are just some of things we do to ensure your child is kept safe and in good spirits throughout the summer:

- A full-time nurse who runs our well-equipped infirmary
- All our staff is trained to preform CPR/First Aid
- Our lifeguards are trained to use our defibrillators
- Each age group has a lifeguard in their group’s staff
- Immediately notify parents on camper's illness
- High lifeguard to camper ratio
- Campers are counted a minimum of 5 times a day to ensure no one goes missing
- Staff is consistently tested to deal with a missing camper throughout the summer ensuring they are always on guard for unlikely situations
- Camper Information Forms are shared with your child’s counselors so they can provide the best quality care.
- A medical clinic staffed with multiple doctors is located 10 minutes away & 2 hospitals are located approximately an hour away in case of emergencies
