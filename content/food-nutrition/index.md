<img class="float-left rounded mr-4 mb-4" src="tomatoes.jpg">The main idea behind our menu is to make sure that the campers are eating nutritious, Kosher meals which they enjoy.  To accomplish this we work hard to provide options at every meal.  We take into consideration that some campers have individual dietary needs, and ensure that those needs are met.  This also includes picky eaters.  We can provide individualized foods to meet dietary needs.Just some of the specific diets we have catered to include organic, coeliac, and gluten-free diets.

We pride ourselves on the quality of our products.  We provide a variety of fruits and vegetables to keep your kids guessing.  We always choose top grade meat.  We also use fresh and locally grown products whenever possible – including from our vegetable garden in which the kids grow the produce themselves!

Gesher prides itself in having an eclectic meal selection.  We recognize that breakfast is an important part of the day and that not everyone likes the same food, which is why we take extra care to offer many options.  To start, every morning we prepare oatmeal, homemade granola, apple sauce, hard boiled eggs, cereal, jam, butter, Wow butter (a soy-nut butter product), olives, yogurt, cottage cheese, fruit salad, and freshly cut cucumbers and tomatoes.  We also provide a main dish which includes pancakes, eggs and hash browns, cinnamon buns, croissants, or English muffins.

Every lunch and dinner we prepare at least a main dish and a side soup and salad.  Some of our main dishes include pizza, chicken wings, mac and cheese, and pulled beef.  We also make traditional Israeli foods like shwarma, falafel, shakshuka, beef kabobs, and humus.

We always put extra effort in making sure our Shabbat dinners are special.  We prepare one of two meals on Friday nights, either a traditional Shabbat chicken dinner, or a thanksgiving turkey dinner.  Our traditional chicken dinner is served with humus, roasted veggies (sweet potato, zucchini, beets, and eggplant).  We also prepare a hearty homemade chicken soup.  Our turkey dinner is served with gravy, mashed potatoes and sweet potatoes, green beans, and cranberry sauce.  For desert we make a delicious pie.

<img class="float-right rounded ml-4 mb-4" src="pizza.jpg">The snacks we serve include cookies, muffins, fruit, and pastries.  We allow the campers to have sugary foods when we feel it’s needed, like on themed days, a few times per session.  We strive to make sure each camper walks away from meal times satisfied. If campers are ever hungry when it is not meal or snack time, all they do is ask our staff and they will always provide our campers something to eat.

The kitchen and food is an important aspect of camp and we try to get the campers involved as much as possible in an effort to teach them about where food comes from and how it’s prepared.  In our kibbutz style camp we believe that children should be as involved in the process of the food they eat as much as possible.  We’re always happy to have the campers help out in the kitchen.
